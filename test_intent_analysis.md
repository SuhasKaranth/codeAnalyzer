# SLM Intent Analysis Test

## Test Message:
"I have already analyzed the repository https://github.com/springframeworkguru/springbootwebapp. Now please explain the specific file src/main/java/guru/springframework/repositories/ProductRepository.java. What does this class/file do? Please provide a detailed explanation of its purpose, main functionality, and key components. Focus on the code structure, methods, dependencies, and how it fits into the overall application architecture."

## Expected Analysis:

### Context Clues:
- Repository is already analyzed ✅
- Contains "explain" keyword ✅
- Contains "what does" keyword ✅
- Contains "detailed explanation" ✅
- Contains specific file path with .java extension ✅
- Contains "class/file" ✅

### Expected Intent: **QUERY_RESPONSE**

### Why NOT ANALYZE_REPO:
- User says "I have already analyzed" (past tense)
- User is asking about existing code, not requesting new analysis
- Primary intent is explanation, not analysis

### Improved Prompt Context:
- SLM will receive context that repository is already analyzed
- Additional notes about file path and explanation keywords
- Clear distinction between analysis vs query intents

## Result:
With the improved system prompt and context building, the SLM should now correctly identify this as **QUERY_RESPONSE** instead of **ANALYZE_REPO**.
